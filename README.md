# Iris Flower Classification Project
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning through the classification of the Iris flower dataset, one of the most popular datasets in data science. The Iris dataset contains features that describe three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple machine learning models that can accurately classify the species based on flower characteristics such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

üí° Key Objectives:

Load and preprocess the Iris dataset.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize patterns and relationships.

Train and evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms, including:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras

Compare the performance of the models based on accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

(Optional) Explore hyperparameter tuning and advanced evaluation metrics.

Dataset Description

The Iris flower dataset consists of 150 samples of three species of Iris flowers. Each sample is described by four features:


Sepal length (cm)

Sepal width (cm)

Petal length (cm)

Petal width (cm)

The target variable (species) is a categorical variable representing the flower species:

0: Iris-Setosa

1: Iris-Versicolor

2: Iris-Virginica

The dataset is clean, meaning there are no missing values or inconsistencies, making it ideal for exploring different machine learning algorithms.

üîß Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis

numpy for numerical operations

seaborn and matplotlib for data visualization

scikit-learn for machine learning models and evaluation metrics

tensorflow and keras for building and training neural networks

üìù Project Workflow

1. Data Loading
We load the Iris dataset directly from Scikit-learn and convert it to a Pandas DataFrame for easier data manipulation. The target (species) is added as a separate column.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is crucial to understanding the relationships between different features. Here, we:

Use Seaborn‚Äôs pairplot() to visualize relationships between the features.
Plot a correlation matrix using a heatmap to identify which features are strongly correlated.

3. Data Splitting and Preprocessing
Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to normalize the data, ensuring that algorithms like SVM and KNN perform optimally.
The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to evaluate model performance.

5. Model Building and Training
We explore various machine learning models to classify the Iris species:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate the classes.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple yet effective classification algorithm based on the proximity of data points.
Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble learning method that uses multiple decision trees to boost classification performance.
Neural Network (using TensorFlow/Keras): A basic neural network with two layers to showcase how deep learning can also be used for small datasets.

5. Model Evaluation
Each model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of predictions.
Confusion Matrix: Visualizes the true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, and F1-score for each class to assess model performance in greater detail.

6. Comparing Models
We compare the performance of the SVM, KNN, Random Forest, and Neural Network models to determine which classifier works best on this dataset.

7. Neural Network (Optional)
For those interested in deep learning, a simple neural network is trained using TensorFlow and Keras. It consists of:

An input layer with 4 nodes (one for each feature),
One hidden layer with 8 nodes using the ReLU activation function,
An output layer with 3 nodes (one for each class) using softmax activation.

8. Further Improvements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Models like KNN, Random Forest, and Neural Networks can benefit from hyperparameter optimization.
Cross-Validation: Implementing k-fold cross-validation to reduce the risk of overfitting and provide a more robust model evaluation.
